			<h1>BIO</h1>
			<div >I will run<br>
				I will climb<br>
				I will soar<br>
				I'm undefeated<br>
				Jumping out of my skin,<br> pull the chord<br>
				I believe it the past,<br> is everything we were<br>
				don't make us who we are <br>So I'll dream, <br>until I make it real
				and all I see is stars.<br> It's not until you fall that you fly.<br>
				When your dreams come alive,<br>
				You're unstoppable.<br>
				Take a shot, chase the Sun, find the beautiful<br>
				We will glow in the dark,<br>turning dust to gold<br>
				And we'll dream It possible<br>

				I will chase,<br> I will reach,<br> I will fly<br>
				until I'm breaking<br>
				Out of my cage<br>like a bird in the night<br>
				I know I'm changing into something big<br>
				better than before.<br>
				And if it takes a thousand lives,<br>
				Then it's worth fighting for.<br>It's not until you fall that you fly.<br>
				When your dreams come alive,<br>you're unstoppable.<br>
				Take a shot, chase the Sun, find the beautiful<br>
				We will glow in the dark,<br>
				turning dust to gold.<br>
				And we'll dream It possible!<br>
